# Telegram Otaku Searcher

## Idea

I take inspiration from the reddit bot of /r/manga that fetch manga from different sources and show it as a comment. I want something similar for Telegram and also I want to build something in my free time, and thus this bot came to exists. So far it only fetchs manga and anime from the Anichart API but eventually I would like to add more sources and update the message formatting.

## How to use it

First search for @otakuSearcherBot and start a conversation. There you can send messages with `< >` to find animes or with `[ ]` to find mangas. Easy as that.

But on other hand I'm thinking in changing the way the bot receives the search command, and make it work with commands instead, I'm still thinking about it
